Hi Nitesh,

I hope you’re doing well. I would like to propose establishing a small, informal data‐and‐analytics sub‐team within JPMorgan Asset Management. This group would comprise individuals from Client, Operations, and Investments who are engaged in Python programming and data science. The objective is to foster a sense of connection among like‐minded colleagues in the broader organization, facilitate knowledge sharing, and collectively showcase our capabilities at industry events, Innovation Weeks, hackathons, and through relevant certifications.

**Purpose and Objectives**

* **Strengthen Collaboration:** Create a forum in which professionals across Client, Operations, and Investments can exchange ideas, share tools, and discuss best practices.
* **Upskill with Emerging Technologies:** Keep the group informed of the latest advancements in libraries and frameworks—such as pandas, Dask, PyTorch, Numba, and Spark—and encourage hands‐on experimentation.
* **Standardize Best Practices:** Develop and circulate guidelines for version control, code quality, model validation, and data governance.
* **Facilitate Professional Development:** Support participation in certifications (e.g., FRM, CQF, AWS Certified Machine Learning, Coursera’s Machine Learning for Finance) to ensure consistent standards and credibility.
* **Enhance External Visibility:** Coordinate joint submissions to DevUp, Innovation Weeks, internal hackathons, and external conferences (e.g., PyData Finance, Strata), thereby demonstrating JPMAM’s commitment to data‐driven innovation.

**Expected Benefits**

1. **Reduced Redundancy and Accelerated Delivery**

   * By sharing existing code libraries and modules—such as Python backtesting frameworks or automated data‐ingestion scripts—teams can avoid duplicative effort and accelerate project timelines.

2. **Improved Knowledge Transfer and Innovation**

   * Regular meetings will highlight new techniques (e.g., leveraging Numba for just‐in‐time compilation, implementing distributed processing with Dask) and inspire collaborative prototypes (e.g., a real‐time risk‐monitoring dashboard).

3. **Upskilling and Professional Growth**

   * Group discussions and knowledge‐sharing sessions will facilitate rapid adoption of new tools.
   * Encouraging certifications ensures a uniform baseline for model development, validation, and governance.

4. **Stronger Employer Branding and Team Recognition**

   * Presentations at DevUp, Innovation Weeks, and hackathons will raise JPMAM’s profile internally and externally.
   * Demonstrating our data‐science capabilities can help attract and retain top talent.

**Proposed Activities**

1. **Bi‐Weekly “Technical Briefings” (20 Minutes)**

   * Short, focused presentations on specific topics (e.g., “Implementing a Python‐Based VaR Engine,” “Leveraging NLP for Earnings‐Call Analysis”).
   * Distribute reference materials and code samples via a shared repository.

2. **Monthly “Problem‐Solving Forums” (30 Minutes)**

   * Open‐forum discussions where participants present challenges (e.g., “Optimizing Monte Carlo Simulations with Dask”) and solicit collective input.

3. **Quarterly “Mini Hack Sprints” (2–3 Hours)**

   * Cross‐functional teams collaborate on proof‐of‐concept projects (e.g., automated factor‐signal generators, ML‐powered credit‐risk prototypes).
   * Conclude with demonstrations; promising solutions may be proposed for inclusion in the formal development roadmap.

4. **Event Representation and Recap Sessions**

   * Rotate ambassadors to prepare abstracts and deliver presentations at DevUp, Innovation Weeks, hackathons, or external conferences.
   * After each event, conduct a brief “brown‐bag” session to disseminate insights, share slides, and identify potential applications.

**Next Steps**

1. **Compile Participation List**

   * Coordinate with management to identify and compile names of individuals across Client, Operations, and Investments who are currently engaged in Python and data‐science activities.
2. **Establish a Dedicated Communication Channel**

   * Create a Slack or Teams channel (e.g., “#jpmam‐py‐analytics”) to facilitate ongoing dialogue, share resources, and coordinate activities.
3. **Schedule an Introductory Session**

   * Organize a 30‐minute kickoff meeting involving team leads and yourself to outline the sub‐team’s objectives, review proposed activities, and gather initial feedback on topic interests.

This structure is intentionally lightweight, with no formal governance overhead. It is a volunteer‐driven initiative designed to strengthen collaboration, accelerate skill development, and enhance our collective impact. I would welcome any feedback or adjustments you may have.

Thank you for considering this proposal.
