I’ll extract the text from these images for you. Let me process them now.

Here is the extracted text from your images:

Slide 4

For this prototype demonstration, we have taken most of the global & quant factors to test the ability of the recommender.
→ [This tool]

⸻

Slide 5

→ This is how recommended screen looks like for Screening. (PAK about Quintile)
→ Look at area of [crossed-out text]
→ So you are looking at our parity at the year of your performance-driven split by Underweight & Overweight.

⸻

Slide 6

The tool takes the top & bottom quintiles of the factor data for overweight & underweight / 4.
It scores based on normalized return.
This score is penalized if that quintile bucket is very highly volatile or not statistically significant.

→ The tool is flexible through its constraint setting to tune the recommendations.
→ Few constraints we have used are:
	•	Suggest factor quintile with some recent initiation.
	•	Portfolio Remove

→ Significance & Randomness of the Quintile.
→ Constraint setting can be adjusted to align with investment style needs.

Let me know if you need any refinements or clarifications!
